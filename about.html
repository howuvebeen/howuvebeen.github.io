        <p>How you’ve been? I am Yubin Heo, a junior at Cornell University majoring in Information
             Science System Technology at College of Engineering. I am also minoring in Game Design.</p>
        <p>I was born in South Korea and attended international boarding schools ever since I was 12
             years old. My ability to openly embrace diverse cultures comes from that. I have the drive and
              motivation to invest time and effort to go and learn something brand new.</p>
        <p>I like the process of a work more than its result; regardless of how troublesome and complex it
             is. I truly enjoy conceiving ideas, drawing up a project for it, and realizing what I imagined.
              What brought me a bigger joy is not a success on the first compilation but a success on
               increasing efficiency after creating the same function with better algorithms. </p>
        <p>In my spare time, I direct and produce short films, spend time with my dog, and play video
             games. I also love food and visiting good restaurants with my family and friends.</p>
        <p>Let's get in touch!</p>

        <p> How you’ve been? I am <span class="color-text">Yubin Heo</span>, a junior at <span class="color-text">Cornell University</span> majoring in <strong>Information
            Science System Technology</strong> at <span class="color-text">College of Engineering</span>. I am also minoring in Game Design.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born in <span class="color-text">South Korea</span> and attended international boarding schools ever since I was 12
            years old. My ability to openly embrace diverse cultures comes from that. <strong>I have the drive and
            motivation to invest time and effort to go and learn something brand new.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I like the process of a work more than its result; regardless of how troublesome and complex it
            is. <strong>I truly enjoy conceiving ideas, drawing up a project for it, and realizing what I imagined.</strong>
            What brought me a bigger joy is not a success on the first compilation but a success on
            increasing efficiency after creating the same function with better algorithms. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I direct and produce <strong>short films</strong>, spend time with my <strong>dog</strong>, and play <strong>video
            games</strong>. I also love <strong>food</strong> and visiting good restaurants with my family and friends.
        </p>
